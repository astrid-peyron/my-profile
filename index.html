             <h2> Traveling 🛶 </h2>
               <p>
    	       I have been traveling since I am in High School. I did an exchange program in Colombia which allowed me to discover more Latin America. What I love in travelling is that it can be linked to a purpose. I traveled for sports, to visit family, for my studies or simply by pure curiosity. There are no limites in traveling. Every country can be discovered and each place has its own part of mistery and history.

                 <h2> Lyon 🏙 </h2>
                  <p>
                  	I come from Lyon, a city in the South of France, most known for its architecture and food. It the world capital of gastronomy. What I love about this city is that is close to the mountains and the see.
